## AI Blogger with Gemini - Python Script (Google Colab)

This project provides a Python script for creating a basic AI blogger using the Gemini library. It accompanies the tutorial on Job Ready Programmer's Youtube channel.

**Description:**

This script allows you to provide a topic, and the AI will generate a blog post based on that topic using the capabilities of Gemini. 

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* Gemini library (installation: `pip install gemini`)
* Google Colab account (for running the script)

**Usage:**

1. Clone this repository or download the script (main.py).
2. Open the script (main.py) in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in the YouTube lesson, which likely involve:
    * Installing the `gemini` library (if not already installed)
    * Defining the topic for the AI to blog about
    * Running the script

**Output:**

The script will generate a blog post based on the provided topic and display it within the notebook.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic example. You can explore the Gemini library further to customize the generated blog posts (refer to the Gemini documentation).
* Feel free to ask questions in the comments section of the YouTube video!
